🧠 Mathematical Tools for Big Data

💡 Proposal Ideas for Simple Fuzzy Logic Applications

1. 🏦 Bank Risk Assessment
Inputs: Customer’s age, income, debt level, and credit history.
Logic: Use fuzzy rules (e.g., high income with low debt is low risk; high debt with poor credit history is high risk).
Output: A risk score ranging from 0 (low risk) to 10 (high risk).
2. 🏥 Medical Symptom Severity Analysis
Inputs: Frequency, duration, and intensity of symptoms (e.g., headache, fatigue).
Logic: Use fuzzy rules to evaluate the likelihood of certain conditions.
Output: An alert level from mild to severe, potentially triggering further medical advice.
